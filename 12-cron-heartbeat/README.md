# Step 12: Cron + Heartbeat

> An Agent work while you are sleeping.

## Prerequisites

Same as Step 09 - copy the config file and add your API key:

```bash
cp default_workspace/config.example.yaml default_workspace/config.user.yaml
# Edit config.user.yaml to add your API key
```

## What We Will Build

<img src="12-cron-heartbeat.svg" align="center" width="100%" />


## Key Components

- **CRON.md & CronDef** - Cron Job Definition
- **CronWorker** - Background worker that checks every minute for due jobs
- **DispatchEvent** - Event type for internal message dispatch
- **DispatchResultEvent** - Result event returned from dispatched jobs
- **Cron-Ops Skill** - Skill for creating, listing, and deleting scheduled cron jobs (implemented as a skill to avoid extra tool registry)

[src/mybot/core/cron_loader.py](src/mybot/core/cron_loader.py)

```python
class CronDef(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    description: str
    agent: str
    schedule: str
    prompt: str
    one_off: bool = False
```

[src/mybot/server/cron_worker.py](src/mybot/server/cron_worker.py)

```python
class CronWorker(Worker):
    async def run(self) -> None:
        while True:
            await self._tick()
            await asyncio.sleep(60)

    async def _tick(self) -> None:
        jobs = self.context.cron_loader.discover_crons()
        due_jobs = find_due_jobs(jobs)

        for cron_def in due_jobs:
            event = DispatchEvent(
                session_id=session.session_id,
                source=CronEventSource(cron_id=cron_def.id),
                content=cron_def.prompt,
            )
            await self.context.eventbus.publish(event)
```

[default_workspace/crons/hello-world/CRON.md](../default_workspace/skills/cron-ops/SKILL.md)

The Cron Operation functionaliry is implemented using the **SKILL system** rather than registering dedicated tools which avoids bloating the tool registry.

## Try it out

```bash
cd 12-cron-heartbeat
uv run my-bot server

# From Channel of your choice:

# You: Send me some Cat Meme every morning.
# pickle: I've scheduled a "Cat Meme" cron job you every morning 9 AM. You'll find those meme shortly! *purrs* 🐱
```

## Notes

Openclaw has a HEARTBEAT mechanism apart from CRON system.

- Can only have one HEARTBEAT, and heartbeats runs in main session at a regular interval without checking time.
- Can have multiple CRON, they run in background with respect to cron expressions.
